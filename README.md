# Contemporary Issues In Data: Governments show different appraoch to the collection and storage of Covid-19 data - George Gao
As the Covid-19 pandemic swept the world in 2020, it is more important than ever for health agencies to collect and integrate Covid-related data. Interestingly, many country have opted to limit the database of the central health agencies. Below I presented the responses from the US and Germany government, which has both similarities and differences. 


## Article 1
In [White House Strips CDC Of Data Collection Role For COVID-19 Hospitalizations](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/15/891351706white-house-strips-cdc-of-data-collection-role-for-covid-19-hospitalizations), the author discussed a controversial decision made by the Trump government to bypass the CDC and establish new, private databases.

While the Trump administration's justification of the decision is better "streamline reporting", and that CDC still have full access to all the medical data.The article expresses major concern over the decision, suggesting that it may undermine the public health agencies' data analytical abilities, while also limiting the public's access to Covid-related information. Overall, most experts from CDC believe that the decentralization of Covid data will lead to lower efficiency no matter how well things are executed. 

## Article 2
On the other hand, as discussed in [Germany Backs Away From Compiling Coronavirus Contacts In A Central Database](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/27/846046185/germany-backs-away-from-compiling-coronavirus-contacts-in-a-central-database), while Germany also refrains from a centralized digital contact tracing program amid the pandemic, the reason for such decision is quite diffferent from that of the US.

Contact tracing identifies Covid-19 carriers, and notify (an potentially monitor) anyone who has contracted these carriers. German official originally preferred a centralized system for easier data integration and better efficiency. However, their requirement of major businesses, such as Google and Apple, to change the settings on their phones to allow for the collection of information, is rejected due to privacy concerns.
